# Metadata API

Welcome to the Metadata API! 
This backend service allows you to manage metadata for your Items, LootBoxes, and Keys. If you're interested in the associated smart contracts, please visit our [LootboxContract repository](https://github.com/3engine/LootboxContract).

While this backend provides a foundational structure, it's designed to be a starting point. We encourage the community to enhance and tailor it to their needs. Contributions and improvements are always welcome!
